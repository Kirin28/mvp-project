# mvp-project

Forever Active is a full stack website built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and SQL for the database. 
The project's features include a search across the SQL database of workouts. The search method was conducted using a junction table, combining a list of workouts and a list of search keywords. Morevoer, the project enables the admin of the website to add more workouts using the input form, adding them to the database and displaying them. 
The users are able to watch workouts either on the website and be redirected to YouTube. In the future, I plan to add more functionality, such as saving user's favorite workouts, marking the workouts as complete and calculating the calories burned. 
The design I created for the website was first prototyped on Figma and later implemented using Bootstrap, react-bootstrap and CSS.
